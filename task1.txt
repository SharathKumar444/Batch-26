SECTION A: Technical Questions

1. What is the difference between var, let and const?
var: Declares variable with function or global scope and allows re-declaration and updates within the same scope.
let: Declares variable with block scope, allowing updates but not-redeclaration within the same block.
const: Declares block scoped variables that cannot be reassigned after their initail assignment

2. Which keyword allows redeclaration and why?
 Answer: Var
 Reason: Var is function-scoped, so redeclaring the same variable in the same scope is allowed.

3. Which keyword allows reinitialization?
 Answer: var and let
 Reason: Both allow assigning a new value after declaration.

4. Which keyword does not allow redeclaration and reinitialization?
 Answer: const
 Reason: A const variable must be assigned once and cannot be changed or redeclared 

5. Why should const be used for fixed values?
 Answer: Const prevents accidental reassignment, improves code safety, and makes the intent of fixed values clear.

6. What error occurs when redeclaring a let variable?
 Answer: SyntaxError: Identifier has already been declared

7. What error occurs when reassigning a const variable?
 Answer: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

8. Which keyword is preferred in modern JavaScript and why?
 Answer: let and const
 Reason: They provide block scope, avoid bugs caused by var and improve code readability and safety.

9. Can const be declared without initialization? Explain.
 Answer: No.
 Reason: const must be assigned a value at the time of declaration.
 Example :
 const x; // Error

10. When should var be avoided?
 Answer:var should be avoided in modern JavaScript because it is function-scoped and can cause unexpected bugs 

 Section-B: Code-Based Question

 11. Predict the output
var a = 10;
a = 20;
var a = 30;
console.log(a);
Output: 30
 Reason: Var allows redeclaration and reinitialization.

12. Predict the output
let b = 5;
b = 15;
console.log(b);
 Output:15
 Reason: let allows reinitialization but not redeclaration.

13. Identify the error
let x = 10;
let x = 20;
 Error: SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared.
 Reason: let does not allow redeclaration in the same scope.

14. Identify the error
const y = 50;
y = 100;
 Error: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
 Reason: const values cannot be reassigned.

15. Write a program using var to show redeclaration.
 Code:
var a = 10;
var a = 20;
console.log(a);
 Output:20

16. Write a program using let to show reinitialization.
let count = 5;
count = 10;
console.log(count);
 Output: 10

17. Write a program using const and explain why value cannot change.
 const PI = 3.14;
// PI = 3.1415; // Error
console.log(PI);
 Explanation: const prevents changing values once assigned.

18. Convert var to let where applicable.
// Before
var age = 25;
age = 26;
// After
let age = 25;
age = 26;

19. Convert var to const where applicable.
// Before
var country = "India";
// After
const country = "India";

20. Write your own example for var, let, and const.
 // var example
var city = "Delhi";
var city = "Mumbai";
console.log(city);
// let example
let score = 50;
score = 75;
console.log(score);
// const example
const language = "JavaScript";
console.log( language);
